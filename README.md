#pre-requisites
  - visual studio code
  - windows os
  - make sure chromedriver.exe version matches chrome browser which is located on BrowserNodes
  
  I added all dependencies on this repo,usually there is no need because they can be auto generated when you build the project but I felt it safe to have them here for this occasion.

This test was developed using visual studio 2019 on Windows
I then used visual studio code on a mac to commit on github, reason for that is, I have git setup on the mac, and visual studio was easy to setup on windows as it was my first time using it.

To get the test, 
  - download the project on the link
  - unzip it,
  - navigate to the folder via visual studio at the location where you downloaded the file
  - open the DigiOutsourceAutomation.sIn which will pull the project and its dependencies
  - Build the projects to get any missing dependencies
  - then you can run the tests from the test explorer

The report should be located in a folder call extentReport on the C: drive.
