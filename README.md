# DIgiOutsourceAutomation
This test was developed using visual studio 2019 on Windows
I then used visual studio code on a mac to commit on github, reason for that is, I have git setup on the mac, and visual studio was easy to setup on windows as it was my first time using it.

To get the test, 
  - download the project on the link
  - unzip it,
  - navigate to the folder via visual studio at the location where you downloaded the file
  - open the DigiOutsourceAutomation.sIn which will pull the project and its dependencies
